# Another clocktwo clone

After already developing a prototype of a word clock, this is now my second attempt at creating this awesome piece of furniture from scratch. I learned from some of the lessons of the first version and applied my best practices in this project. Below an instruction set on how I build it.

### Hardware (same as last time):
1. Arduino Uno (https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3)
2. AZDelivery RTC Chip (https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01M2B7HQB/ref=twister_B07ZQGBH14?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)
3. WS2812E LED Strip (https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B088FJLRFP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)
4. copper cables (https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01BI1G88C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
5. power cable (https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B075TXKC9D/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

### Woodwork
1. Base 40.8 x 40.8
2. Top/Bot seperator 40.8 x 5
3. Left/Right seperator 36.8 x 5
4. LED plate 33.4 x 38.6
5. Acryl plate with satin effect 40.8 x 40.8
6. Acryl plate with non reflective glass 36.8 x 36.8
7. Front cover 40.8 x 40.8 with 36.8 x 36.8 cut in middle

Most of the wood can be ordered at https://expresszuschnitt.de/ I chose for multiplex for all components. 

### Design
I used the attached pdf file as template in Formulor to get a laser cut letter plate, which was afterwards placed between the 2 Arcyl plates. Design also available as svg (usage of pdf for Formulor recommended).
